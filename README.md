- 👋 Hi, I’m @IvanMitrevski
- 👀 I’m interested in coding !important, drawing, playing video games, and self-improvement... for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and soon I want to start learing Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will make me understand how the IT industry works.
